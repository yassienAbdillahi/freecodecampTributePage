<!--
Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNqgVx.

Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Give it your own personal style.

User Story #1: My tribute page should have an element with a corresponding id="main", which contains all other elements.

User Story #2: I should see an element with a corresponding id="title", which contains a string (i.e. text) that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug").

User Story #3: I should see either a figure or a div element with a corresponding id="img-div".

User Story #4: Within the img-div element, I should see an img element with a corresponding id="image".

User Story #5: Within the img-div element, I should see an element with a corresponding id="img-caption" that contains textual content describing the image shown in img-div.

User Story #6: I should see an element with a corresponding id="tribute-info", which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.

User Story #7: I should see an a element with a corresponding id="tribute-link", which links to an outside site that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. HINT: You must give your element an attribute of target and set it to _blank in order for your link to open in a new tab (i.e. target="_blank").

User Story #8: The img element should responsively resize, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size.

User Story #9: The img element should be centered within its parent element.

Plan:
- Write out the semantic html
- then sort out the structure using css grid
- and lastly, play with the formatting using css

          <p>These days when the name Ronaldo is mentioned most people, <em>especially young people</em>, immediately think of <i>Cristiano</i>, the Portuguese superstar who has been at the center of world football for the last <b>18 years</b>. But before there was ever a <abbr title="Cristiano Ronaldo 7">CR7</abbr>, <abbr title="Ronaldo 9">R9</abbr>, also known as O Fenômeno, was ripping defences to shreds with his unique combination of pace, power, balance, grace and, above all, technique.</p>

        <h2 id="bio" class="item4">So who is he?</h2>
          <p>Ronaldo Luís Nazário de Lima, born 18 September 1976, is widely considered one of, if not <strong>the</strong>, greatest player of all time. José Mourinho, himself one of the most successful managers in the modern era, holds this view. This is him speaking about Ronaldo: <blockquote cite="https://www.tribalfootball.com/articles/mourinho-names-ronaldo-nazario-as-greatest-player-of-all-time-4300274">if we are talking strictly about talent and skill, nobody surpasses Ronaldo [Nazario]. When he was at Barcelona with Bobby Robson, I realised that he was the best player I'd ever seen....the talent that that 19-year-old boy had was something incredible."</blockquote>

        <h2 id="style" class="item5">How did he play?</h2>
          <p>Lightning fast and ridiculously strong, Ronaldo was blessed with the physical attributes to compete at the highest level of the game. What made him special and once in a generation though was the fact that he was equally skilled and gifted in the technical department. His touch, vision, passing, finishing and legendary dribbling meant that he posessed the elite-level abilities of several different attacking positions; number 10, winger <b>AND</b> striker.<br><br>The following excellent YouTube video showcases some of his most breathtaking displays:
